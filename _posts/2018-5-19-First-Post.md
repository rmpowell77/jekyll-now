title: My First Post!
---

At C++Now 2018 I was chatting with [Arthur O'Dwyer](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/) about how to construct a blog.  He pointed me to ["Jekyll Now"](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), a way to set up a blogging platform with github.  It looks both fun and easy to use!

My goal with this blog is to both collect and post ideas that I have, as well as improving my communication and writing skills.  I'm excited to see how it goes!
